Case Study Proposal option #1

In 2017 Major League Baseball introduced Statcast, a revolutionary baseball “physics” system that measures every movement on a baseball diamond by using Doppler radar and High Def cameras. 

Statcast keeps a publicly available database that stores every pitch and situation and generates CSV files. 

Statcast is amazing, because rather than analyze games from a traditional stats (Batting Average, On Base Percentage, Earned Run Average, etc.) which is skewed due to many situational variables, we can look at the cause and effect of physics within the game and get a better understanding of what makes a player or team effective.  

My proposal is to explore an aspect of baseball from a physics perspective, specifically the effect of Spin(RPM) of a fastball and its effect on Launch Angle (LA) on fair contact.  


The rows will include every fair contact pitch from fastballs in the 2019 season. 

The columns will include: Pitch Spin Rate (RPM), Pitch Velocity, Exit Velocity from bat, Launch Angle from bat, hit result (Putout, single, double, triple,HR), Hit distance, Barrel % .

Case study Proposal #2

Using a database of domestic US flights from 1990 to 2009. I would like to explore the flights that where the empties. By looking at each flight in the dataset we can find the % of seats that were empty on a flight. I would like to explore which routes they were and what time of year produced empty flights.

Case Study Proposal option #3

Using a database that tracks international Air traffic data arriving and departing the US from 1990-2020. I would like to look at where flights originate and depart to in order to better understand international travel preferences have changed over the the last 30 years.
